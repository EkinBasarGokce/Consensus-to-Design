# consensus_to_design
Automatic primer design algorithm with consensus genome provided to it.

To design primers with preferred length, first you need to create a consensus genome out of alignments of your target sequence. This can be a gene region or a whole genome. A consensus genome preparation script will follow, hopefully soon.
